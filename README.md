# JustFly

JustFly is another electronic airspace chart. I would like to add airspaces for the countries,
which enables private pilots to fly without the need for subscriptions to different electronic maps.
Basically, chart data is already accessible and public. This app only displays it.
For now it is only available for Android. It is possible to add XY Tilesources (Slippy Tiles).
It is also possible to display openair files.

## Countries

 - Austria
 - Hungary
